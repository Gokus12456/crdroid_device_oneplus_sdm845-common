## Hola amiguitos

This is my attempt to fix up and add a little crDroid customization flavor back into the sdm845-common device tree for OnePlus 6 & 6T (enchilada & fajita).

Rebased on the official lineage-21 branch of the LineageOS device tree (plus EdwinMoq's patches for kernel 4.19 support) as of March 2024.
